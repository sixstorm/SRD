# SRD
Simple Reddit Digest

This is a personal, small project, using Python, PRAW, and Jinja, producing a small, self-hostable image only site, powered by Reddit content.  

**Upcoming Reddit API changes could break this project entirely**

## Setup

Log into your Reddit account and create a new application.  

Copy 'settings_example.json' to 'settings.json':

```bash
cp settings_example.json settings.json
```

Edit 'settings.json' and fill in the Client ID and Secret from your Reddit Application.  Also make sure to put something, like your username, in the "User Agent" field.

## Docker
